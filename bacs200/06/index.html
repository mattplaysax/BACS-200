    <h3>Outline</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Economic Theory</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Free trade is known to benefit the global economy.</li>
                <li>Through specialization and exchange every country is better off.</li>
                <li>Trade restrictions tend to hurt economies.</li>
                <li>Tariffs tend to cause consumers to have to pay more for goods.</li>
            </ol> 
        <li>U.S. and China Relations</li>
            <ol>
                <li>The U.S. and China have the biggest economies in the world and are each otherâ€™s top trading partners.</li>
                <li>It doesn't make sense to start a trade war with your biggest trading partners.</li>
                <li>The data shows that the trade wat has hurt both countries economies.</li>
                <li>Both countries need to work together to stay competitive in the global economy; not tear each other down.</li>
            </ol> 
        <li>America's Trade Deficit</li>
            <ol>
                <li>America has been in a trade deficit for a long time.</li>
                <li>It is not a bad thing to have a trade deficit.</li>
                <li>China provides the U.S. with a source of cheap goods.</li>
                <li>The trade war won't necessarily save American jobs. Tariffs will make American goods more expensive making America less competitive in the global market.</li>
            </ol> 
        <li>Intellectual Property</li>
            <ol>
                <li>A big reason for the trade war is to try to punish China for intellectual property theft.</li>
                <li>A lot of companies that work with China get their product lines ripped off.</li>
                <li>A lot of companies that work in China are forced to share their technological secrets.</li>
                <li>These are valid reasons to be upset with China. But, it's a delicate matter and I don't know if a trade war is the right answer.</li>
            </ol> 
    </ul>
