           What makes an artist great is it there passion for the craft? Is it their raw talent? or is it their ability to push the limits of themselves
        </p>
        <p>
            The artists that inspire me the most are the ones that always push the envelope
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>They are always pushing themselves and othere around</li>
            <li>They always push their craft to new limits and scopes</li>
            <li>They inspire others to be better versions of themselfs</li>
            <li>They always come up with new ways to move forward and entertain people</li>
            <li>Most of all they love their art and will keep doing it regardless of any fiancial or social inventive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           My Greates inspiration is Dj Qbert. He has always been one of my favorite artists and has inspired me to be a bette artist myself. The thing I love most about Qbert is his enthusiasm for his art and his push to keep learning and striving to push the scope of turntablism. Qbert also is without a doubt not only one of the best dj's in the world but one of the world's greatest musicians and the only way to truly get an idea of this mans talent is to see him live.
